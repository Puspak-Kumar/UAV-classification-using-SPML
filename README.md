# UAV-classification-using-SPML
Advanced radar-based classification system for detecting and distinguishing UAVs, birds, and RC aircraft using SVMD signal decomposition and deep learning feature extraction

✅ Project Direction 

our system will:

A. Collect / Use radar time-series echo returns

B. Decompose signal using one or more of:

    1. STFT

    2. EMD (Empirical Mode Decomposition)

    3. Wavelet Packet Decomposition

    4. Hilbert Transform

C. Extract micro-Doppler & temporal features

D.Train a classifier to distinguish:

    1.UAV (quadrotor or small drone)

    2.Birds

    3.RC Aircraft

✅ Key Reason Why Time-Series Works

Bird wings,
Drone propellers,
RC aircraft rigid-body motion
→ All create different micro-Doppler signatures and periodic motions.

So classification is absolutely possible using only time-domain signals.
