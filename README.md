# UAV-classification-using-SPML
Advanced radar-based classification system for detecting and distinguishing UAVs, birds, and RC aircraft using SVMD signal decomposition and deep learning feature extraction

✅ Project Direction (Confirmed & Correct)

Your system will:

Collect / Use radar time-series echo returns

Decompose signal using one or more of:

STFT

EMD (Empirical Mode Decomposition)

Wavelet Packet Decomposition

Hilbert Transform

Extract micro-Doppler & temporal features

Train a classifier to distinguish:

UAV (quadrotor or small drone)

Birds

RC Aircraft

✅ Key Reason Why Time-Series Works

Bird wings,
Drone propellers,
RC aircraft rigid-body motion
→ All create different micro-Doppler signatures and periodic motions.

So classification is absolutely possible using only time-domain signals.
